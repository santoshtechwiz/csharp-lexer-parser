# C# Lexer and Parser

This repository contains a lexer and parser implemented in C#. These components are essential for tokenizing and parsing structured text or code. This project can be a fundamental building block for various applications that involve interpreting, processing, or transforming textual input.

## Components

The project includes the following key components:

-   `Lexer.cs`: This file contains the lexer implementation responsible for breaking down input text into tokens.
-   `Parser.cs`: The parser takes the tokens generated by the lexer and processes them according to a defined grammar or set of rules.
-   `LexerException.cs`: This file contains custom exception classes that handle lexer-specific exceptions.
-   `Expression.cs`: This class or file may contain expression-related logic or structures depending on your specific use case.
-   `Node.cs`: The Node class represents the parsed structure created by the parser.
-   `Number.cs`: This file could handle numeric values or data within the lexer and parser.
-   `Token.cs`: The Token class defines the structure of tokens generated by the lexer.
-   `Utility.cs`: The Utility class or file may contain helper functions or utility methods that aid in lexer and parser operations.
-   `LexerParser.csproj`: The project file that organizes and builds these components.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can clone the repository to your local machine.

bashCopy code

`git clone <repository-url>` 

Ensure you have C# development tools and environment set up to compile and run the code.

## Usage

You can use this lexer and parser in your own projects by referencing the provided source files or DLLs. To incorporate it into your code, follow these general steps:

1.  Create an instance of the lexer.
2.  Pass your input text to the lexer.
3.  Retrieve the generated tokens.
4.  Pass the tokens to the parser.
5.  The parser will process the tokens according to your specified grammar and produce a structured result.

Remember to adapt and customize the components to suit your specific use case and grammar requirements.
